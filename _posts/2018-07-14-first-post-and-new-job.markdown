Hello friend, and welcome to my brand new blog.

For the last couple of years I've been working at [Fusetools](https://fusetools.com), on the [Fuse Open](https://fuse-open.github.io/) cross-platform mobile app platform. It was a truly great experience getting to work with such an unique talent pool, and I'm proud of the things we achieved together.

However, [Fusetools](https://www.fusetools.com/) recently [changed its direction](https://blog.fusetools.com/announcing-fuse-open-free-ea289bbf32d0), and is now focused on delivering [Apps as a Service](https://www.fusetools.com/apps) instead. I will be skipping the details on that for now; for more insight I recommend reading Andreas RÃ¸nning and Erik Faye-Lund articles on the subject [here](https://medium.com/@sunjammer/on-the-announcement-of-fuse-open-77cce5701351) and [here](https://www.kusma.xyz/blog/2018/05/14/fuse-open.html).

I hope and believe Fusetools will succeed with their new venture, but for me this felt like a good opportunity to move on and look for something new.

So late may I delivered my letter of resignation. Quitting your job before finding a new one can be risky, but from my experience this can work as an excellent [commitment device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device).

And luckily, after a month of interview related stress and sleepless nights, I'm happy to say I accepted an offer from Skala Technologies AS, a Norwegian subsidiary of the AI startup [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/).

Graphcore is working on a brand new processor architecture designed for accelerating machine learning workloads. They call it an IPU, or Intelligence Processor Unit. That is pretty damn cool, and it's an understatement to say I'm _very_ excited about a chance to be a part of this.

I've been wanting to learn more about ANNs (artificial neural networks) ever since I read Jeff Hawkins excellent book [On Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Intelligence) many years ago. And I think this could be the perfect chance to do that.

So now I'm counting down the days left of my summer vacation, eagerly awaiting my first day in my new position.
